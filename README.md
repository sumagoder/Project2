Title:Chatbot using Python and Fuzzy Matching

*Description:*
This is a simple console-based chatbot implemented in Python. It uses difflib's get_close_matches for fuzzy string matching to handle natural language inputs and respond based on a predefined knowledge base (dictionary). The chatbot matches user input with the most similar question in its "brain" and returns a corresponding answer. If no close match is found, it responds with a fallback message.

*Features:*
Fuzzy string matching to handle flexible input
Case-insensitive question handling
Easy-to-extend knowledge base (dictionary)
Exit command for ending the conversation
Lightweight and dependency-free (only uses Python standard library)


*Technologies Used:*
Python 3
difflib for fuzzy matching
typing for type hints


*Usage:* Run the script and start chatting with the bot! Type exit or bye to end the conversation.
